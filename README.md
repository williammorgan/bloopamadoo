This project is a toy music synthesizer made purely for fun.

To listen to the demonstration wave file, enter:

    make demo_song.wav

and then listen to the wav file in your favorite media player.

If you are on Ubuntu, you can simply type `make` or `make listen` and the demo song wave file will be created and played in one step.

## Potential future work:
 * Rythmic notation
 * Vibrato demonstration
 * Simple echos
 * Filters
 * longer demo song
 * ADSR change messages on playing voice without restarting the adsr_generator.
